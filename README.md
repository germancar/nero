Nero is a PHP MVC lightweight framework

This is a project I started a few weeks back as a means to learn more about php mvc development and php in general. I tried to
copy features that I liked from frameworks like Laravel and CodeIgniter, ie Laravel's routing implementation. This has been a 
really fun learning experience, I hope you can find some value in it.

You can follow my tutorials about this implementation at my blog http://markomihajlovic.blogspot.rs/ if you are interested,
and if you want to contribute you are welcome to do so.
